# lockdowncount
A website which displays how many days since the start of the first lockdown in the United Kingdom. 

## 2021 update
Ok, so it's largely redundant now seeing as we've been in 3 lockdowns already and we're only just coming out of the latest one. However it serves as a sort of horrible throwback even if we aren't in lockdown anymore.

## How to run

```
npm install
```

```
npm run-script dev
